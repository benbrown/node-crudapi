# What if you could just generate an API based on a schema?

Define one or more schemas in your model, along with any additional methods you want attached to that schema.

CRUDAPI will create the Mongoose schema, a Node CRUD api, AND a browser API client library.

Both node and client versions of the objects defined in the model will have the same methods and will behave the same.
